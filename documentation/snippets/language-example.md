<!--
  This is a workaround to have language specific annotations, see:
  https://github.com/lord/slate/issues/72
  
  Using this workaround, you don't have to add the '>', the blockquote
  ensures that this will be moved to the right side. In addition, it
  is important that the context is not parsed by markdown, so you have 
  to use html tags.
